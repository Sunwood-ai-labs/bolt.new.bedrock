This project is a fork of ‚Äúhttps://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new‚Äù üöÄ.
All rules depend on bolt.new, so be sure to check it out.

This project includes the following points
‚òëAllows you to choose which LLM to use on the screen
‚òëThe original bolt.new command was for linux environments, so I updated it to work on windows.

Usage:
1. run the following command
```ps:
pnpm install
```

2. Create ‚Äú.env.local‚Äù in the project root and add the following definition
```.env.local
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-yyyyy

# Anthropic API Key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api-xxxxxxxx

# Vite log level
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# AWS Access Key ID
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AAAAA

# AWS Secret Access Key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# AWS Region
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

3. When ready, run the following command in a powershell and you are good to go!
```
pnpm run start
```
